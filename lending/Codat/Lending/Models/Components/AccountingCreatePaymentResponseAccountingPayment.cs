    /// &gt; **Payments or bill payments?**<br/>
    /// &gt;<br/>
    /// &gt;  In Codat, payments represent accounts receivable only. For accounts payable, see <a href="https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/schemas/BillPayment">bill payments</a>. These include <a href="https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/schemas/Bill">bills</a> and credit notes against bills.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// ## Overview<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// Payments include all accounts receivable transaction data. This includes <a href="https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/schemas/Invoice">invoices</a> and <a href="https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/schemas/CreditNote">credit notes</a>.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// A payment in Codat usually represents an allocation of money within any customer accounts receivable account. This includes, but is not strictly limited to:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - A payment made against an invoice, like a credit card, cheque, or cash payment.<br/>
    /// - An allocation of a customer's credit note, either to an invoice or maybe a refund.<br/>
    /// - A payment made directly to that accounts receivable account. This might be an overpayment or a prepayment. It might also be the refund of a payment made directly to an accounts receivable account.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// Depending on the payments allowed by the underlying accounting software, some payment types may be combined. Please see the example for more details.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// In Codat, a payment contains details of:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - When the payment was recorded in the accounting system.<br/>
    /// - How much it is for and in what currency that amount is in.<br/>
    /// - Who the payment was _paid by_ – the _customer_.<br/>
    /// - The payment method used.<br/>
    /// - The breakdown of the types of payments – the _line items_.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// Payments is a child data type of <a href="https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/schemas/AccountTransaction">account transactions</a>.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// ## Payment types<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// ## Payment of an invoice<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// A payment paying a single invoice has one entry in its `lines` array. This **line** has the following properties:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - An _amount_ that indicates the amount of the invoice that was paid. This is always positive.<br/>
    /// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:<br/>
    ///     - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case an `Invoice`.<br/>
    ///     - An **id** that contains the ID of the invoice that was paid.<br/>
    ///     - An **amount** for the link. The sum of the **line.amount** and the **links.amount** must equal `0`.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// ## Payment of multiple invoices<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// A single payment can pay multiple invoices. This can be represented in one of two formats depending on how the customer keeps their books:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - The payment has multiple entries in its **lines** array, one for each invoice that is paid. Each line follows the example and rules described in <a href="#payment-of-an-invoice">Payment of an invoice</a>.<br/>
    /// - The payment has a line with multiple links to each invoice. This occurs when the proportion of the original payment allocated to each invoice is not available.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// Each **line** has the same properties as those described in <a href="#payment-of-an-invoice">Payment of an invoice</a>, with the **amount** indicating how much of the payment was allocated to the invoice. The sum of line amounts equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// ## Payments and refunds on account<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// A payment on account, that is a payment that doesn’t pay a specific invoice, has one entry in its lines array. The **line** has the following properties:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - A **totalAmount** that indicates the amount paid by a customer or refunded to them by a company. A payment to the customer is always negative. A refund is always positive.<br/>
    /// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:<br/>
    /// - A **type** that indicates the type of link. For a payment this is `PaymentOnAccount`. For a refund this is `Refund`.<br/>
    /// - The **id** containing the ID of the customer.<br/>
    /// - The **amount** for the link is `0` – the **totalAmount** _or_ the amount of the payment or refund.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// It is possible to have a payment that is part _on account_ and part _allocated_ to an invoice. Each line should follow the examples above.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// ## Using a credit note to pay an invoice<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// The payment of an invoice using a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This **line** has the following properties:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - An **amount** that indicates the amount of money moved, which in this case is `0`, as the credit note and invoice allocation must balance each other.<br/>
    /// - A **links** array containing two elements:<br/>
    ///     - The first **link** has:<br/>
    ///         - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case an `Invoice`.<br/>
    ///         - An **id** that contains the ID of the invoice that was paid.<br/>
    ///     - The second **link** has:<br/>
    ///         - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `CreditNote`.<br/>
    ///         - An **id** that contains the ID of the credit note used by this payment.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// ## Refunding a credit note<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// A payment refunding a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This **line** has the following properties:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - An **amount** that indicates the amount of the credit note that was refunded. This is always negative for a refund.<br/>
    /// - A **links** array that contains one element with the following properties:<br/>
    ///     - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `CreditNote`.<br/>
    ///     - An **id** that contains the ID of the credit note that was refunded.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// The **totalAmount** field on the payment equals the **amount** field of the **line**. These are both negative, as this is money leaving accounts receivable.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// ## Refunding a payment<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// If a payment is refunded, for example, if a customer overpaid an invoice and the overpayment is returned to the customer, there are two payment records:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - One for the incoming over payment.<br/>
    /// - Another for the outgoing refund.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// The payment issuing the refund has a negative **totalAmount**. This payment also has one entry in its lines array with the following properties:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - An **amount** that indicates the amount that was refunded. This is always negative.<br/>
    /// - A **links** array that contains one element with the following properties:<br/>
    ///     - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `Payment`.<br/>
    ///     - An **id** that contains the ID of the payment that was refunded.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment and is negative, as this is money leaving accounts receivable.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// The payment that was refunded has a line where the **amount** is positive and the type of the link is `Refund`. This payment may have several entries in its **lines** array if it was used to partly pay an invoice.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// For example: A £1,050 payment on a £1,000 invoice with a refund of £50 has two lines:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - One for £1,000 linked to the invoice that was paid.<br/>
    /// - Another for £50 linked to the payment that refunded the overpayment with a** type** of `Refund` and an ID that corresponds to the payment.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// The **line** linked to the payment has the following properties:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - An **amount** that indicates the amount that was refunded. This is positive as its money that was added to accounts receivable. It's balanced out by the negative amount of the refund.<br/>
    /// - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:<br/>
    ///     - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `Refund`.<br/>
    ///     - An **id** that contains the ID of the payment that refunded this line.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// &gt; **Support for linked payments**<br/>
    /// &gt;<br/>
    /// &gt; Not all accounting software support linking payments in this way. In some platforms, you may see a payment on account and a refund on account.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// ## Foreign currencies<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// There are two types of currency rate that are included in the payments data type:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// Payment currency rate:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - Base currency of the accounts receivable account.<br/>
    /// - Foreign currency of the payment.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// Payment line link currency rate:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - Base currency of the item the link represents.<br/>
    /// - Foreign currency of the payment.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// These two rates allow the calculation of currency loss or gain for any of the transactions affected by the payment lines. The second rate is used when a payment is applied to an item in a currency that doesn't match either:<br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// - The base currency for the accounts receivable account.<br/>
    /// - The currency of the item.<br/>
    /// <br/>
    ///   ```json title="Currency rate example"<br/>
