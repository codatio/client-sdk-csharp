    /// - `Submitted` - Invoice is no longer a draft. It has been processed and, or, sent to the customer. In this state, it will impact the ledger. It also has no payments made against it, meaning `amountDue` will usually equal `totalAmount` (unless tax is witheld).<br/>
    /// - `PartiallyPaid` - The balance paid against the invoice is positive, but less than the total invoice amount, meaning `0 &lt; amountDue &lt; totalAmount`.<br/>
    /// - `Paid` - Invoice is paid in full. This includes if the invoice has been credited or overpaid, meaning `amountDue == 0`.<br/>
    /// - `Void` - An invoice can become Void when it's deleted, refunded, written off, or cancelled. A voided invoice may still be PartiallyPaid, and so all outstanding amounts on voided invoices are removed from the accounts receivable account.
