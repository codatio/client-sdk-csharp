    /// ## Overview
    /// 
    /// A cash flow statement is a financial report that records all cash that is received or spent by a company during a given period. It gives you a clearer picture of the companyâ€™s performance, and their ability to pay creditors and finance growth.
    /// 
    /// > **Cash flow statement or balance sheet?**
    /// > 
    /// > Look at the cash flow statement to understand a company's ability to pay its bills. Although the balance sheet may show healthy earnings at a specific point in time, the cash flow statement allows you to see whether the company is meeting its financial commitments, such as paying creditors or its employees.
