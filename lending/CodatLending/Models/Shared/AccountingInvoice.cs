    /// ## Overview
    /// 
    /// An invoice is an itemized record of goods sold or services provided to a [customer](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Customer).
    /// 
    /// In Codat, an invoice contains details of:
    /// 
    /// - The timeline of the invoice—when it was raised, marked as paid, last edited, and so on.
    /// - How much the invoice is for, what portion of the invoice is tax or discounts, and what currency the amounts are represented in. 
    /// - Who the invoice has been raised to; the _customer_.
    /// - The breakdown of what the invoice is for; the _line items_.
    /// - Any [payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Payment) assigned to the invoice; the _payment allocations_.
    /// 
    /// > **Invoice PDF downloads**  
    /// >
    /// > You can <a className="external" href="https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/operations/get-invoice-pdf" target="_blank">download a PDF version</a> of an invoice for supported integrations.
    /// > 
    /// > The filename will be invoice-{number}.pdf.
    /// 
    /// > **Referencing an invoice in Sage 50 and ClearBooks**
    /// >
    /// > In Sage 50 and ClearBooks, you may prefer to use the **invoiceNumber** to identify an invoice rather than the invoice **id**. Each time a draft invoice is submitted or printed, the draft **id** becomes void and a submitted invoice with a new **id** exists in its place. In both platforms, the **invoiceNumber** should remain the same.
