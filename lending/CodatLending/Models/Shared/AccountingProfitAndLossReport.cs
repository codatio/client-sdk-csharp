    /// ## Overview
    /// 
    /// The purpose of a profit and loss report is to present the financial performance of a company over a specified time period.
    /// 
    /// A profit and loss report shows a company's total income and expenses for a specified period of time and whether a profit or loss has been made.
    /// 
    /// > **Profit and loss or balance sheet?**  
    /// > Profit and loss reports summarise the total revenue, expenses, and profit or loss over a specified time period. A balance sheet report presents all assets, liability, and equity for a given date.
    /// 
    /// 
    /// **Structure of this report**  
    /// This report will reflect the structure and line descriptions that the business has set in their own accounting platform.
    /// 
    /// **History**  
    /// By default, Codat pulls (up to) 24 months of profit and loss history for a company. You can adjust this to fetch more history, where available, by updating the `monthsToSync` value for `profitAndLoss` on the [data type settings endpoint](https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/operations/post-profile-syncSettings).
    /// 
    /// **Want to pull this in a standardised structure?**  
    /// Our [Enhanced Financials](https://docs.codat.io/assess/reports/enhanced-financials/financials) endpoints provide the same report under standardized headings, allowing you to pull it in the same format for all of your business customers.
